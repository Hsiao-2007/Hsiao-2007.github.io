Hi, my name is Hsiao-Shan Graham
This is my in progress github space, that I hope to add a working bash terminal to in order to give an authentic bash terminal experince
I am learning some langauges as of now, but am hoping to start learning QT in a little while.
I use Arch and openSuse linux, but also windows or debian based distros if need be
